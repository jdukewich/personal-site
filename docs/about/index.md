# About Me
I graduated from Penn State University in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and honors in Computer Science. My passion for computer science is evident in my coursework, professional experience, and extracurricular activities. Specifically, I am extremely interested in artificial intelligence, cryptography, networking, and web development.

I have web development experience from my software engineering internship experiences, and I have worked with artificial intelligence and natural language processing through a part-time job with the Nittany AI Alliance at Penn State.

In college, I dedicated a large amount of my time as a volunteer of the Penn State Dance Marathon (THONâ„¢). In my role as a Systems Administrator on the Technology Committee, I have been able to combine my passions for computer science and volunteering. This role has allowed me to learn and apply industry-standard technologies, such as Docker, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Splunk, and Django.

Now, I work as a Software Engineer for Capital One, where I help build the credit card applications on the main website.

Some of my hobbies include running, skiing, and playing sports (soccer, tennis, and volleyball mostly). I also enjoy programming side projects, such as personal websites.
