# About Me
I graduated from Penn State University in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and honors in Computer Science. My passion for computer science is evident in my coursework, professional experience, and extracurricular activities. Specifically, I am extremely interested in artificial intelligence, cryptography, networking, and web development.

I have web development experience from my software engineering internship experiences, and I have worked with artificial intelligence and natural language processing through a part-time job with the Nittany AI Alliance at Penn State.

In college, I dedicated a large amount of my time as a volunteer of the Penn State Dance Marathon (THON™). In my role as a Systems Administrator on the Technology Committee, I have been able to combine my passions for computer science and volunteering. This role has allowed me to learn and apply industry-standard technologies, such as Docker, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Splunk, and Django. Please check out more about THON™ at their website [THON.org](https://thon.org).

Now, I work as a Software Engineer for Capital One. On my first team, I used React to help build the credit card applications on the main website. My current team uses React, Node, and DynamoDB to build cyber security automations as part of our enterprise SOAR platform.

I am also pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science degree through Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. I chose the Computing Systems specialization, taking courses related
to operating systems, distributed system, and much more.

Some of my hobbies include running, skiing, and playing sports (soccer, tennis, and volleyball mostly). I also enjoy programming side projects, such as personal websites.
