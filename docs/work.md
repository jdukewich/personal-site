# My Work
I enjoy programming side projects to help make some things easier. You can find more on my [Github](https://github.com/jdukewich) (opens in new tab). The following projects are some examples of work I've done on the side or for school.

## Undergraduate Honors Thesis
My honors thesis investigated syntax highlighting for unsafe API functions in the C programming language. The aim of this thesis was to create a static analysis tool to provide on-the-fly highlighting of C code that can be considered risky or unsafe based on its potential for misuse.

## Self-Hosted Website Analytics

I forked the self-hosted website analytics called [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee) (opens in new tab), and made some changes so that it could run using AWS DynamoDB instead of MongoDB. Therefore, I am able to run these analytics for nearly free on AWS utilizing their free tier for API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

## AWS Server Toggle

I made this website to serve as a way to toggle an AWS EC2 server on and off. This will allow you to save costs instead of having the EC2 always running. Some use cases could include hosting dedicated servers for games like Minecraft while minimizing your cost.
